# Fixing the Artistic AI Issue

## Problem
The "Artistic AI" option in the coloring book generator is not working because the OpenAI API key is not configured.

## Solution
You need to add your OpenAI API key to the backend environment file.

### Steps:

1. **Get your OpenAI API key:**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
   - Create a new API key or copy an existing one

2. **Add the API key to your environment file:**
   - Open `backend/.env`
   - Add this line: `OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here`
   - Replace `your_actual_openai_api_key_here` with your real API key

3. **Your backend/.env file should look like this:**
   ```
   # API key for Ideogram image generation service
   IDEOGRAM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
   # OpenAI API key for ChatGPT and DALL-E (required for Artistic AI option)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key-here
   
   # Server port
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Restart the backend server:**
   - Stop the current backend server (Ctrl+C)
   - Run `cd backend && npm start` again

## Verification
After adding the API key and restarting the server, the "Artistic AI" option should work correctly and generate coloring book scenes.

## Code Changes Made
- Fixed the API URL in the frontend from `localhost:5000` to `localhost:3000` to match the backend port
- Identified the missing OpenAI API key as the root cause

## Cost Consideration
- The DALL-E API has usage costs (approximately $0.04 per 1024x1024 image with standard quality)
- The Creative Engine (Ideogram) may have different pricing
- Make sure you understand the costs before generating many images
